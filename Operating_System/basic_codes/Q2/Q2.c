/*
>>2 repeat the  problem 1, by changing the nice values of each instance,
    using renice command, use renice to modify the values in +ve range only,
    like +5 | +10 | +15 ­ observe using ps and top commands – what are your
    conclusions ?

    Note : with administrative privileges, you can change the nice priority
           values to ­ve values, which will provide very large time­share values
           to processes !!! you can assign ­5 | ­10 | ­10 | ­20 to different
           processes on a given processor/scheduler instance

           refer to manual pages of renice !!!
