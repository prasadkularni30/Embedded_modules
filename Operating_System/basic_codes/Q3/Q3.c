/*
>>3 using chrt. utility, can you modify scheduling policy of active applications/
    processes, in problems 1) to FIFO or RR, with appropriate real­time
    priorities – use the following policy and priority assignments ???

    a) assign FIFO with equal priority to a few processes and assign TS policy
       to a few processes – you need to assign these processes to a specific
       processor / scheduler instance
    b) assign RR with equal priority to a few processes and test – once again,
       you need to assign these processes to a specific processor/scheduler
       instance.
